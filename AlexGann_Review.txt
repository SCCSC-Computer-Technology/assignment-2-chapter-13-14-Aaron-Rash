The interface is neatly organized, though I feel that the side panel listing the product descriptions may be redundant.

Another issue I had with the interface is that it wasn't readily apparent whether the 'less than' and 'more than' buttons 
were for the number of items in stock or for the price. They should have more labeling added.

Using double equal signs for the product number and description may not be good form. Especially with the description, 
I initially thought it was broken when testing it before viewing the code. Using 'contains' will allow for partial entries 
to be searched.

I am somewhat surprised to learn, testing again, that double equals does not require matching case.

The sort by price and sort by units buttons are a nice touch, but having a way to sort by product number again would also 
be a nice touch.

Otherwise, good work.
