I think it is a good habit to always change the Form1 Text property so that in the top left of the window it says something indicative about the form instead of just Form1. It would have been informative to the user to have had tool tips on the buttons of the form. I think it would be useful to have a way to reset the data grid view after searches.
The product description search only worked if you type exactly what the products description is. It may have been more beneficial to use the Contains method in the where statement of your LINQ query. Then the user could just put in shirt and recive all of the shirts available for example.
Our solutions were different in that this program shows both the product grid view and a list box with a short hand of the products being searched for which can be useful for users in a hurry. My solution used just the product grid view as means for the user to see the data returned from their search.
